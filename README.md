# 📐 My linters and formatters configurations

This is the config files that I use to code beautifully and keep coding that way.

This repo is separated by [branches](https://github.com/gu-does-git/configs/branches), so that I can have different configurations to each environment OR tech that I'm using at that time.

## Required stuff

-   Node version >15 (i'm using 17.5.0)

## How to use

0. Clone the desired [branch](https://github.com/gu-does-git/configs/branches) and open it in VSCode.

1. Open a terminal inside VSCode and install all the node dependencies.

```shell
 npm i
```

2. Install all the [recommended extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace#_recommended-extensions) into VSCode.

## What I'm using

-   [ESLint](https://github.com/dustinspecker/awesome-eslint)
    > I use it to enforce code quality and other stuff on my JS/TS files.
-   [Stylelint](https://github.com/stylelint/awesome-stylelint)
    > I use it to sniff out errors and such on my CSS and SCSS files.
-   [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
    > I use it to enforce an consistent format into all of my files.

## How to tweak

To tweak it, please refer to the official docs of each linter and/or formatter. (it's pretty simple)
